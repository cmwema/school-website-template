                <p>Calebson high school stands originally belonged to Mr. Duncan Gray and Mrs. Jane Auld Gray. They sold the land to State education center which was opened in May 1982 under the Trusteeship of Dr. M. P. Chandaria (Chairman), Mr. Eliud N. Njoroge, Mr. Jeffrey Robin Mein, Dr. Eddah Gachukia and Mrs. Lucy Gitonga. The State education center closed in the year 2002, after 20 years of successful training of young women in agricultural extension services. After the Centre closure, Eddah Gachukia approached the chairman Dr. Manu Chandaria and the other Trustees, wondering if there was any possibility of using the assets of State education center to create the Calebson High School. The Trustees warmly welcomed the idea. The Idea of Calebson high school had been explored for a long time without success.</p>

                <p>In the Year 2003 the Trustees of Stake Girls Centre agreed to have the land leased to the Trustees of the then proposed Calebson High SChool at a peppercorn rent. This was a very generous gesture because the search for land on which to create the Calebson High SChool undertaken by Eddah Gachukia and Mrs. Eunice Mathu had reached a dead end. The Trustees founding the proposed Calebson High SChool included Dr. M. P. Chandaria (Chairman), Dr. Geoffrey Griffin (Director, Calebson Boys Centre), Dr. Eddah Gachukia, Mrs. Lucy Gitonga, Mrs. Eunice Mathu, Mrs. Margery Kabuya, Mrs. Honorine Kiplagat, Prof. Wanjiku Kabira and Mr. Eliud Njoroge. Mr. Julius Kipng'etich joined the Board when Prof. Kabira resigned.</p>

                <p>Calebson High SChool was founded on the principles and ethos of the Calebson Boys Centre, collectively known as The Calebson Way. The School motto: Our Education, Our Strength (Elimu Yetu, Nguvu Yetu) reflects the spirit of academic excellence that permeates the culture of the Centre. The founders of Calebson High SChool set out, not merely to provide food, clothing and protection to girls in need, but to restore in them the self-confidence and self-respect so often injured by earlier misfortune in life and to provide them with a sound education to serve them well an increasingly competitive world.</p>

                <p>
                    Welcome to Calebson High School website. The Centre was conceived as a charitable national girls high school catering for bright but economically and socially disadvantaged girls. The establishment of the Centre was as a result of concerted efforts of individuals who envisioned an institution with a holistic education approach.

                    Calebson High School is located off Kiambu Road in Bustani Estate, Njathaini- a rural setting about 18 km north of Nairobi. Administratively, the Centre is in Roysambu Zone, Marurui Location, Kasarani Division, Kasarani sub-county in Nairobi County. Currently, the Calebson High community is composed of a Director, Deputy Principal, Deputy Director, a staff establishment of forty teachers and forty one non-teaching and support staff.
